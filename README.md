# Project Overview
This project focuses on real-time exercise detection using Mediapipe for pose estimation and an LSTM model for classifying exercises based on keypoint data. Throughout the development process, I applied rigorous testing and debugging techniques to ensure the system's accuracy and reliability, especially when handling real-time data from a webcam.

The project has been structured in a way that makes testing and debugging an integral part of the development process. This helped me ensure that each part of the system works as expected before integrating it into a fully functional real-time application.


## Technologies I Used
** Python for scripting and overall application logic. ** 
** Mediapipe for real-time pose detection.
** OpenCV to handle video feeds from the webcam.
TensorFlow/Keras for building and training the LSTM model.
pytest and unittest for writing and running tests.
Mocking with unittest.mock to simulate external dependencies like the webcam feed and model loading.
Logging and Debugging tools to trace and fix issues during real-time execution.
